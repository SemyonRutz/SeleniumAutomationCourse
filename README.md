# Selenium Automation Course


This repository contains files and scripts I created while completing a comprehensive Udemy course on QA Automation with Python. Throughout the course, we have learned Selenium WebDriver, leveraging its power to automate web testing tasks effectively. Additionally, we explored the Pytest framework and Robot framework, integrating them seamlessly into our automation workflows.


**Highlights:**

+ **Selenium WebDriver:** Mastered the usage of Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, enabling efficient testing across different web applications.

+ **Pytest Framework:** Learned how to utilize Pytest, a powerful testing framework for Python, to create robust and scalable test suites.

+ **Robot Framework:** Explored the capabilities of the Robot framework, allowing for easy-to-read test cases and enhanced keyword-driven testing.

+ **Test Development:** Created a variety of test cases and scenarios to practice applying different methods and keywords learned throughout the course.

+ **Report Generation:** Implemented strategies to generate detailed reports using the automation frameworks, facilitating comprehensive assessment and analysis of test results.



Feel free to explore the files and scripts provided here. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn more about QA Automation or an experienced tester seeking to enhance your automation skills, I hope you find this repository valuable.
